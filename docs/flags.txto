== TDoc flags

Attributes declared at the top level and prefixed with the `tdoc:` namespace
will act as directives that impact the parsing process of the rest of the
document, and won't be included in the output.


Specifying indentation
======================

The  `@tdoc:indent MODE[=COUNT]` specifies how indentation will be interpreted starting on the next line. `MODE` can be `tabs` or `spaces` and `COUNT] is a positive integer.

```
@tdoc:indent spaces=2
@tdoc:indent tabs
```

Setting default processors
==========================

The `@tdoc:process NODE=PROCESSOR â€¦` defines a mapping between node names and processor types.

```
@tdoc:process text=markdown uml=plantuml
```

# EOF
